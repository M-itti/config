You can add the xrandr command to your startup applications through the command line using the following steps:

Open a terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T on your keyboard.
Type the following command to create a new desktop file for your startup application:
arduino
Copy code
sudo nano /usr/share/applications/external-monitor-setup.desktop
Note: You can replace "external-monitor-setup" with any name you like for your startup application.

In the text editor that opens, paste the following content:
css
Copy code
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=External Monitor Setup
Exec=xrandr --output HDMI-1 --mode 1920x1080 --right-of eDP-1 --primary
Terminal=false
Press Ctrl + X on your keyboard, then press Y to save changes and Enter to exit nano.
Make the new desktop file executable with the following command:
bash
Copy code
sudo chmod +x /usr/share/applications/external-monitor-setup.desktop
Reboot your system or log out and log back in to see the changes take effect.
Now, every time you start Ubuntu, the xrandr command will be executed automatically, and your external monitor will be configured according to the settings you specified.
